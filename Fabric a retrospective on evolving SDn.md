## MAIN
An ideal network design should cover software and hardware

### Software

+ **Simple:** inexpensive to build and operate
+ **Vendor neutral:** easily switch hardware vendor
+ **Future proof:** accommodate future innovation

### Hardware
+ **Flexible:** support like *(isolation, virtualization, traffic engineering, access control)* capable to meet future requirement

**MPLS** important in VPN deployment, traffic engineering   

Network infrastructure:    
**network requirement**
+ *Hosts:-* want packet to a particular dest and hv QoS
+ *Operators:-* boarder requirement(traffic engineering, virtualization, tunneling, isolation)

**network interfaces**                            

+ *Host-Network:-* host inform the network about the requirement

+ *Operator-Network:-* operator inform the network about the requirement

+ *Packet-Switch:-* packet identify itself to a switch

## 1.Original Internet
1.packet按src-dest传输    
2.routing algs     

## 2.MPLS
2.3待研究

## 3.SDN
2.4

**Main problem:**
1. not fulfill the promise of simplified hardware    
2. not provide sufficient flexibility    
3. unnecessary zzzzzz
