### Cloud computing 
cost-effective and scalable processing

### SDN
flexibility in network management service and reduced operational cost


## Thought


highly programmable net- work monitoring to enable attack detection and a flexible control structure to allow fast and specific attack reaction


- provides an unique opportunity to enhance the DDoS attack defense in an enterprise network environment
-  highly scalable and flexible DDoS attack mitigation architecture that exploits SDN technique to address the new security challenges brought by cloud computing, including the extended defense perimeter and
the dynamic network topological changes




SDN-based network monitoring and control mecha- nism allow companies to control and configure their defense mechanisms in the cloud effectively without affecting other cloud users
